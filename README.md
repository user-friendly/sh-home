## ABOUT

Bash aliases, scripts and program configuration files tailored to my
specific tastes.

## CONTENTS

Shell color variables.
Aliases of ```rm```, ```mv``` and ```cp``` for prompting before file overwrites.
Aliases for drush and drush debugging.
Git aliases and single word alias completion (e.g.
completion works with ```alias gco='git checkout'``` ).
Fancy colorful prompt.

Emacs, tmux & git configuration files.

## TODO

Don't load emacs backup files from .bash_conf.d (usually ending in ~).
Maybe have an ignore list.
